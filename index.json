Her research approach combines novel statistical methods and mechanistic mathematical models in order to study complex data sets, answer ecological questions, and help improve fisheries management. She\u0026rsquo;s also easily distracted by colleagues\u0026rsquo; statistical quandries. When not writing beautiful R code, she enjoys eating good food with friends and propelling herself in a variety of modes over trails, roads, rocks, water, and snow.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://okenk.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Biography Kiva completed her BA in Math at Carleton College in 2010 and her PhD at the University of Washington in the Quantitative Ecology \u0026amp; Resource Management (QERM) program in 2016, followed by postdocs at Rutgers University and the University of Washington/NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center.
