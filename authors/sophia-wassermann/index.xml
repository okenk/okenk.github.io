&lt;h3 id=&#34;biography&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophia has been developing her quantitative skills alongside her interests in ecology and conservation from her BA in Environmental Studies from Vassar College to her PhD in Marine Science from NUI Galway, with stops along the way at the School for Field Studies in the Turks &amp;amp; Caicos Islands, a Fulbright student grant at the University of Iceland, and a MSc in Biodiversity &amp;amp; Conservation from Trinity College Dublin. Her research focuses on the intersection of fisheries and climate change, applying computational approaches including individual-based models to fisheries assessment and management. When away from the desk, she likes to spend as much time near the water as possible, along with cooking, baking, and knitting.&lt;/p&gt;
