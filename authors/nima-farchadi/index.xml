&lt;h3 id=&#34;biography&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nima is a PhD student in the San Diego State University - University of California, Davis Joint Doctoral Program in Ecology. Nima completed his MSc in Marine Science at University of San Diego studying the spatiotemporal distribution and habitat preferences of blue and black marlin in the eastern Pacific Ocean. His PhD research focuses on characterizing the spatiotemporal distribution of fishing vessels and highly migratory species under climate change scenarios using species distribution models, remote sensing, and climate models. This research is part of a collaborative project with researchers from University of Washington, NOAA, and Gulf of Maine Research Institute, that is developing a dynamic ocean management tool (FaCeT) that will help support climate-ready and sustainable fisheries. When he isn&amp;rsquo;t behind his computer writing code, you can find him outside hiking, surfing, snorkeling, camping, or enjoying good food and movies with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
